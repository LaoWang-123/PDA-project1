## Introduction

This analysis is rooted in research conducted by Dr. Lauren Micalizzi, which investigates the impact of smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure on adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing behaviors. The dataset comprises baseline data of a subset of adolescents and their mothers, with subsequent follow-up assessments planned at 6 and 12 months post-baseline. The aim of this exploratory data analysis is to examine effects of SDP/ETS on adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing.

## Analysis variables description

Before dealing with missing value, I want to make sure which variables are important in our following analysis in aim of examining effects of SDP/ETS on adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing. This part will definitely affect our decision in how to deal with missing values.

### (1) Exposure Variables:

We only care about the exposure to smoking during pregnancy (SDP), environmental tobacco exposure (ETS) to mom during pregnancy, and envrionmental tobacco exposre (ETS) to children in the immediate postpartum period. We seperate and define our focused variables below:

**SDP-variables**:

-   `mom_smoke_16wk`, `mom_smoke_22wk`, `mom_smoke_32wk`: Indicate mom smoking status at various pregant periods.
-   `cotimean_34wk` : Indicate the Urine continine (nicotine metabolite) at 34 wks gestation.

**ETS-variables**:

-   `mom_smoke_pp1`, `mom_smoke_pp2`, `mom_smoke_pp12wk`, `mom_smoke_pp6mo`: Indicate mom smoking status at various postpartum periods.
-   `cotimean_pp6mo`, `cotimean_pp6mo_baby`: Indicate the Urine cotinine (nicotine metabolite) at 6 months postpartum from mom and baby.

### (2) Outcome Variables:

**Adolescent Self-Regulation**: Variables indicating the adolescent's self-regulation ability, which might involve emotional, cognitive, and behavioral control.

-   `bpm_att`, `erq_cog`, `erq_exp`, `bpm_att_p`

**Substance Use**: Variables indicating the adolescent's usage of substances like tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs.

-   `cig_ever`, `num_cigs_30`, `e_cig_ever`, `num_e_cigs_30`, `mj_ever`, `num_mj_30`, `alc_ever`, `num_alc_30`

**Externalizing Behaviors**: Variables indicating behaviors that are outwardly directed and may include hyperactivity, aggression, etc.

-   `swan_hyperactive`, `bpm_ext`, `bpm_ext_p`

### (3) Demographic Covariates:

**children Variables**:

-   `tage`, `tsex`, `language`, `tethnic`, `taiain`, `tasian`, `tnhpi`, `tblack`, `twhite`, `trace_other`

**Parental/Maternal Variables**:

-   `page`, `psex`, `plang`, `pethnic`, `paiain`, `pasian`, `pnhpi`, `pblack` ,`pwhite`, `prace_other`, `employ`, `pedu`, `income`

## Missing Data Pattern

In the second part of this report, our objective is to assess the missing values within the dataset. Upon reviewing the dataset, we identified two types of missing values: - `NA` for numeric columns - `""` for character columns.

We initially converted the `""` values into `NA`. Subsequently, we utilized a heatmap to visualize the missing values in the dataset. Within the heatmap, blue signifies a missing value.

The columns with the most significant number of missing values, exceeding 40, are as follows: - `num_cigs_30`: 48 missing values - `num_mj_30`: 46 missing values - `num_e_cigs_30`: 47 missing values - `num_alc_30`: 45 missing values

These variables all pertain to the substance use category. Conversely, we have another set of variables - `e_cig_ever`, `mg_ever`, `alc_ever`, `cigs_ever` - that have only 12 or 13 missing values. We are inclined to use these latter variables as outcome variables for subsequent analyses. The rationale being, the `num_30` variables offer more detailed and quantifiable data on substance use, while the latter set merely determines prior usage.

Upon examination of our heatmap @fig-missing, we observed that there are 10 participants with a substantial number of missing values across multiple columns, including demographic details related to children and their mothers. These participants exhibit a consistent pattern of missing values, as evident from the heatmap. However, crucial variables such as **SDP**, **ETS**, **race**, and `swan_hyperactive` (indicative of **Externalizing Behaviors**) remain intact for these participants. Considering the fact that we only have 49 observations in our dataset, so we want to include the participants in our study. The critical technique to analyze such a small size data is to subdivide these data into subgroups, which can be used in different univariate analysis targeting our research aim.

```{r}

# Count NAs in each row
na_count_rows <- apply(data, 1, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

```

## Demographic Covariates Distribution

In this part of report, we want to see the population distribution in the research. We can see the distribution of participants' race, age, employment, education, and income.

In the **Age** plot presented in @fig-age, it's evident that parents' ages, ranging from 32 to 45, exhibit a broader spectrum compared to the children's ages, which fall between 12 and 16. The data originates from a subset of adolescents and their mothers, all of whom were initially part of a previous study focusing on smoke avoidance interventions. While the research exclusively incorporates adolescents, the age at which their mothers gave birth inherently varies, spanning from 18 to 32. It's plausible to consider that a mother's age at childbirth could influence the child's growth and development. Nonetheless, given that our study encompasses only 49 observations, we must operate under the assumption that age does not exert a significant impact, particularly when compared to the notably more severe effects of *SDP* and *ETS*.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-age
#| fig-cap: Density of Age

# Plot function define
variable_den <- function(data_melted,xtitle){
  ggplot(data_melted, aes(x=value, fill=variable)) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.5) +
  labs(x=xtitle,
       y="Density",
       fill="Variables") +
  theme_minimal()
}

# Age
ptage <- data[, c("page", "tage")] %>% melt() %>% filter(!is.na(value))
p_age <- variable_den(data_melted = ptage,xtitle = "Age")

p_age
```

In the **Employment** plot, we observe that a preponderance of parents maintain full-time employment, ostensibly presenting a facade of enhanced stability and prosperity compared to their part-time employed counterparts. A plausible inference might be that wealthier families, typically associated with full-time employment, are endowed with more abundant resources, thereby better positioning them to nurture and educate their children. This enhanced capacity for child-rearing could, theoretically, enable children to develop healthier life habits and possibly attain higher scores in self-regulation questionnaires.

However, it's crucial to acknowledge that employment status, and by extension socioeconomic status, could introduce confounding variables into our analysis. The discernible associations between parental employment and children's self-regulation might be influenced, or even obscured, by these underlying socioeconomic factors. For instance, access to superior educational resources, nutritious food, and a stable living environment, often more readily available to wealthier families, can significantly sculpt a child's development and self-regulating capabilities. Consequently, the intricate role of employment status as a potential confounder warrants meticulous consideration and, where possible, statistical adjustment in future analyses to accurately decipher the authentic impact of Smoking During Pregnancy (SDP) and Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) on adolescent outcomes

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Employment

employ <- data[, c("employ")] %>% melt() %>% filter(!is.na(value))

# Plot
p_employ <- ggplot(data, aes(x=factor(employ))) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..count.., fill = factor(employ)), stat="count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue", "red", "green"),
                    name="Employment Status",
                    breaks=c("0", "1", "2"),
                    labels=c("No Job", "Part-time", "Full-time")) +
  labs(x="Employment Status",
       y="Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1))

p_employ
```

In the **Race** plot in @fig-race,a notable disparity is evident between the race distributions of parents and children. While certain racial categories, such as American Indian/Alaska Native, White, Hispanic/Latino, and Other, exhibit minor fluctuations between parents and children, substantial variations are present in others.

For instance, while there are 8 Pacific Islander parents recorded, no children are categorized under Pacific Islander. Conversely, despite the absence of Black parents in the data, there are 15 Black children. Furthermore, a significant decline is observed in the count of White individuals from parents to children.

This discrepancy challenges conventional expectations, as children typically share the same racial designation as their parents. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon could stem from situations where parents identify with multiple racial categories, allowing children the flexibility to select their own racial identification. Additionally, the presence of missing values or opting not to provide a race could contribute to this imbalanced data representation.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-race
#| fig-cap: Race self-report

#### This is for the bar plot.
# Race

# Select and reshape relevant columns for ggplot
parent_race_cols <- c("pethnic","paian", "pasian", "pnhpi", "pblack", "pwhite","prace_other")
child_race_cols <- c("tethnic","taian", "tasian", "tnhpi", "tblack", "twhite","trace_other") 
# Replace with actual column names

# Melt the data and create a column for race
parent_race <- melt(data, id.vars = "parent_id", measure.vars = parent_race_cols) %>% filter(value %in% c(1))
child_race <- melt(data, id.vars = "parent_id", measure.vars = child_race_cols) %>% filter(value %in% c(1))

# Add a column to indicate whether the record belongs to a child or parent
parent_race$demographic <- "Parent"
child_race$demographic <- "Child"

# Combine the data into a single data frame
all_race <- rbind(parent_race, child_race)
#all_race <- rbind(all_race,c(1000,"tnhpi",0))
#all_race <- rbind(all_race,c(1001,"pblack",0))

# Define custom colors and order

  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 35, hjust = 1))

```

In @fig-edu, which illustrates the **education** plot, it is evident that the predominant educational attainment among parents in our study is "some-college education." This is closely followed by those possessing a 4-year degree, which represents the second-largest category. In contrast, individuals with a postgraduate degree and those with only high school education constitute smaller segments. The distribution of educational levels, with the exception of the 4-year degree category, broadly resembles a normal distribution within our dataset.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-edu
#| fig-cap: Parents Education Distribution

# Education

education <- data[, c("pedu")] %>% melt() %>% filter(!is.na(value))

# Plot
p_edu <- ggplot(data, aes(x=factor(pedu))) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = ..count.., fill = factor(pedu)), stat="count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue", "red", "green","yellow","purple","orange","lightgreen"),
                    name="Education Status",
                    breaks=c("0", "1", "2","3","4","5","6"),
                    labels=c("some high school", "high school", "GED","some college","2 year degree","4 year degree","postgraduate degree")) +

```

In Figure @fig-income, we can see the parents **income** appears to follow a uniform distribution if we ignore the 80k-100k group, which has only 1 person. The majority of people in our dataset have an annual income of 40k-60k. However, it's important to note that there are 13 people who do not have an income record. This will undoubtedly affect our parents' income distribution.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-income
#| fig-cap: Parents income distribution

# Convert income to numeric, handling non-numeric entries and missing values
Income=data[,c("parent_id","income")]
Income$income <- as.numeric(as.character(data$income))

# Categorizing income
Income$income_category <- cut(Income$income, 
                            breaks = c(-Inf, 20000, 40000, 60000, 80000, 100000, Inf),
                            labels = c("<20K", "20K-40K", "40K-60K", "60K-80K", "80K-100K", "100K+"),
                            right = FALSE,
                            include.lowest = TRUE)

# Handling NA values if needed
Income$income_category <- factor(Income$income_category, levels = c("<20K", "20K-40K", "40K-60K", "60K-80K", "80K-100K", "100K+"), exclude = NULL)

## Main analysis for effects of SDP/ETS on adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing

This is the main part of this report. In this part, we will conduct six analyses to detect the effect of SDP/ETS on adolescent self-regulation, substance use, and externalizing. Due to a substantial amount of missing values in the dataset, different subsets of the original data will be utilized for these analyses.

### SDP variables preprocessing

As discussed in the variables section, we have `mom_smoke_16wk`, `mom_smoke_22wk`, `mom_smoke_32wk`, and `cotimean_34wk` to denote **SDP**.

`mom_smoke_16wk`, `mom_smoke_22wk`, and `mom_smoke_32wk` indicate whether moms had smoked during different pregnancy periods, so we aim to collapse them into one variable: `Mom_Smoke_p`. We will combine these four columns and `cotimean_34wk` into one table to explore their relationship in terms of missing values. A strong relationship between `Mom_Smoke_p` and `mom_smoke_32wk` was found. Every mom who reported smoking at 32 weeks has a urine cotinine level over 40. We define an imputation method: if `cotimean_34wk` has a value < 2, and we have a missing value in `Mom_Smoke_p`, then we will substitute the missing value with no-smoke. Consequently, we have 11 missing values in our SDP variable.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# make new variable of Mom_Smoke_xxwk,with numeric data.
data$Mom_Smoke_16wk=NA
data$Mom_Smoke_16wk[data$mom_smoke_16wk=="1=Yes"]=1
data$Mom_Smoke_16wk[data$mom_smoke_16wk=="2=No"]=0

data$Mom_Smoke_22wk=NA
data$Mom_Smoke_22wk[data$mom_smoke_22wk=="1=Yes"]=1
data$Mom_Smoke_22wk[data$mom_smoke_22wk=="2=No"]=0

data$Mom_Smoke_32wk=NA
data$Mom_Smoke_32wk[data$mom_smoke_32wk=="1=Yes"]=1
data$Mom_Smoke_32wk[data$mom_smoke_32wk=="2=No"]=0

data$Mom_Smoke_p=NA
data$Mom_Smoke_p[data$Mom_Smoke_16wk==1 | data$Mom_Smoke_22wk==1|data$Mom_Smoke_32wk==1]=1
data$Mom_Smoke_p[data$Mom_Smoke_16wk==0 & data$Mom_Smoke_22wk==0 & data$Mom_Smoke_32wk==0]=0 # 0 means don't smoke.

### if some missing value exist, but there are 0, then we will say it 0. Because most moms
data$Mom_Smoke_p[data$cotimean_34wk<2 & is.na(data$Mom_Smoke_p)]=0

data.mom_smoke <- data[,c("Mom_Smoke_16wk","Mom_Smoke_22wk","Mom_Smoke_32wk","Mom_Smoke_p","cotimean_34wk")]
```


### ETS variables preprocessing

Several variables pertain to adolescents' ETS exposure during early postpartum periods, including `mom_smoke_pp1`, `mom_smoke_pp2`, `mom_smoke_pp12wk`, and `mom_smoke_pp6mo`, which signify the mother's smoking status at distinct postpartum intervals. The implication is straightforward: if a mother smokes, her baby is likely exposed to ETS. The handling of ETS variables mirrors the approach taken with SDP variables.

The variables `cotimean_pp6mo` and `cotimean_pp6mo_baby` represent the urine cotinine (a nicotine metabolite) levels at 6 months postpartum for both mother and baby, respectively, serving as quantifiable indicators of the extent to which both were affected by smoking.

Upon analysis, it was observed that `cotimean_pp6mo` and `cotimean_pp6mo_baby` share identical patterns of missing values across observations. Furthermore, there is a considerable number of missing values in the postpartum smoking records for mothers. Given that cotinine levels provide a more quantifiable measure, we opted to utilize the `cotimean_pp6mo` and `cotimean_pp6mo_baby` variables in lieu of the maternal smoking records.

```{r}
#| echo: false

# make new variable of Mom_Smoke_xxwkpp,with numeric data.
data$Mom_Smoke_pp1=NA
data$Mom_Smoke_pp1[data$mom_smoke_pp1=="1=Yes"]=1
data$Mom_Smoke_pp1[data$mom_smoke_pp1=="2=No"]=0

data$Mom_Smoke_pp2=NA
data$Mom_Smoke_pp2[data$mom_smoke_pp2=="1=Yes"]=1
data$Mom_Smoke_pp2[data$mom_smoke_pp2=="2=No"]=0

data$Mom_Smoke_pp12wk=NA
data$Mom_Smoke_pp12wk[data$mom_smoke_pp12wk=="1=Yes"]=1
data$Mom_Smoke_pp12wk[data$mom_smoke_pp12wk=="2=No"]=0

data$Mom_Smoke_pp6mo=NA
data$Mom_Smoke_pp6mo[data$mom_smoke_pp6mo=="1=Yes"]=1
data$Mom_Smoke_pp6mo[data$mom_smoke_pp6mo=="2=No"]=0

data$Mom_Smoke_pp=NA
data$Mom_Smoke_pp[data$Mom_Smoke_pp1==1 | data$Mom_Smoke_pp2==1|data$Mom_Smoke_pp12wk==1 | data$Mom_Smoke_pp6mo==1]=1
data$Mom_Smoke_pp[data$Mom_Smoke_pp1==0 & data$Mom_Smoke_pp2==0 & data$Mom_Smoke_pp12wk==0 & data$Mom_Smoke_pp6mo==0]=0 # 0 means don't smoke.


data_ms_pp <- data[,c("Mom_Smoke_pp1","Mom_Smoke_pp2","Mom_Smoke_pp12wk","Mom_Smoke_pp6mo","Mom_Smoke_pp","cotimean_pp6mo","cotimean_pp6mo_baby")]

```

### Adolescent Self-Regulation variables preprocessing

Variables such as `bpm_att`,`bpm_att_p`, `erq_cog`, and `erq_exp` denote **Adolescent Self-Regulation**.

`erq_exp` and `erq_cog` represent the average response on the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire related to Expressive Suppression or Cognitive Reappraisal, respectively. `bpm_att` and `bpm_att_p` are the sum of responses on the Brief Problem Monitor on items related to attention problems, both from child self-reports and parent reports for their children. Some correlation between them was also discovered. Therefore, we plan to use the mean of `bpm_att` and `bpm_att_p` to represent the attention problem. If there is one missing value, then we will use the data from the other column. The same approach will be applied to `erq_exp` and `erq_cog` for emotion regulation. Finally we get `Bpm_att` and `Erq` as our final variables.

```{r}
#| echo: false

#cor(data$bpm_att,data$bpm_att_p,use = "pairwise.complete.obs")
#cor(data$erq_cog,data$erq_exp,use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

data$Bpm_att=NA
data$Bpm_att=(data$bpm_att+data$bpm_att_p)/2
data$Bpm_att[is.na(data$Bpm_att)]=data$bpm_att[is.na(data$Bpm_att)]
data$Bpm_att[is.na(data$Bpm_att)]=data$bpm_att_p[is.na(data$Bpm_att)]

data$Erq=NA
data$Erq=(data$erq_cog+data$erq_exp)/2
data$Erq[is.na(data$Erq)]=data$erq_cog[is.na(data$Erq)]
data$Erq[is.na(data$Erq)]=data$erq_exp[is.na(data$Erq)]

data_sereg <- data[,c("Bpm_att","bpm_att","bpm_att_p","Erq","erq_cog","erq_exp")]
```

### Substance Use variables reprocessing

The variables `cig_ever`, `num_cigs_30`, `e_cig_ever`, `num_e_cigs_30`, `mj_ever`, `num_mj_30`, `alc_ever`, and `num_alc_30` are utilized to depict substance use among adolescents. Nevertheless, `num_cigs_30`, `num_e_cigs_30`, `num_mj_30`, and `num_alc_30` exhibit a substantial amount of missing values in our dataset. The remaining four variables mirror the substance type represented by these four variables, namely cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol, respectively. Consequently, we will exclude the four 'num' variables and rely on the alternate four variables for our analysis focused on substance use. These selected variables exhibit a consistent pattern of missing data, facilitating a smoother data analysis process.

```{r}
#| echo: false
data_substance <- data[,c("cig_ever","e_cig_ever","mj_ever","alc_ever")]
```

### Externalizing Behaviors variables reprocessing

The variables `swan_hyperactive`, `bpm_ext`, and `bpm_ext_p` serve to signify behaviors that are externally directed, potentially encompassing hyperactivity and aggression, among others. The swan_hyperactive variable represents the sum of responses on SWAN Rating Scale Questions 1-9, where a score of 6 or higher suggests a likelihood of ADHD - Hyperactive/Impulsive type in the child. Both `bpm_ext` and `bpm_ext_p` represent the sum of responses on the Brief Problem Monitor relating to children's externalizing problems. Remarkably, there are no missing values in `swan_hyperactive`. For `bpm_ext` and `bpm_ext_p`, we intend to compute the average of the values and employ imputation for any missing values, maintaining consistency with our prior approach.

```{r}
#| echo: false

#data$swan_hyperactive
#data$bpm_ext
#data$bpm_ext_p

data$Bpm_ext=NA
data$Bpm_ext=(data$bpm_ext+data$bpm_ext_p)/2
data$Bpm_ext[is.na(data$Bpm_ext)]=data$bpm_ext[is.na(data$Bpm_ext)]
data$Bpm_ext[is.na(data$Bpm_ext)]=data$bpm_ext_p[is.na(data$Bpm_ext)]

data_ext <- data[,c("Bpm_ext","bpm_ext","bpm_ext_p")]
```

## Regression model and Analysis

In this part, we made regression models to investigate the associations between SDP/ETS effect and adolescents' behavior, self-Regulation, substance use, and externalizing behaviors. The code and model fitting can be found in appendix.

### 1. SDP Effect on Adolescent Behavior

We use `Mom_Smoke_p`, `cotimean_34wk` to denote the SDP effect, as discussed in the last part.

#### a. Self-Regulation

Using the `mgcv` package, we investigated the association between SDP indicators (`Mom_Smoke_p` and `cotimean_34wk`) and adolescent self-regulation markers (`Bpm_att` and `Erq`). Key findings include:

- `Mom_Smoke_p` was significantly associated with `Erq` (p = 0.0182). Adolescents with mothers who smoked during pregnancy had, on average, an `Erq` score 0.8341 units higher.
- `cotimean_34wk` did not show a significant relationship with `Erq` (p = 0.146).

#### b. Substance Use

We examined the impact of SDP on adolescent substance use:

- **Cigarette Use (`cig_ever`)**: Both maternal smoking and cotinine levels were significantly related (p = 0.0336 and p < 2e-16 respectively).
- **E-cigarette Use (`e_cig_ever`)**: Both predictors were significantly associated, explaining 76.3% of the variance.
- **Marijuana Use (`mj_ever`)**: Only cotinine levels were significant (p = 0.0039), explaining 60% of the variance.
- **Alcohol Use (`alc_ever`)**: Neither predictor was significant, accounting for 23.8% variance.

#### c. Externalizing Behaviors

Exploring associations with adolescent hyperactivity (`swan_hyperactive`) and externalizing behaviors (`Bpm_ext`):

- **Hyperactivity**: Neither SDP predictor was significant.
- **Externalizing Behaviors**: Both predictors were not significantly related.

### 2. ETS Effect on Adolescent Behavior

We chose to utilize the `cotimean_pp6mo` and `cotimean_pp6mo_baby` variables to denote the ETS effect on children.

#### a. Self-Regulation

We assessed the associations between ETS exposure (`cotimean_pp6mo` and `cotimean_pp6mo_baby`) and self-regulation:

- **Self-Regulation (`Bpm_att`)**: Only maternal cotinine levels at 6 months postpartum were significant (p = 0.0334).
- **Emotional Regulation (`Erq`)**: Neither ETS predictor was significant.

#### b. Substance Use

Investigating the relationship between ETS exposure and adolescent substance use:

- **Cigarette Use (`cig_ever`)**: Only maternal cotinine levels were significant (p = 0.00518).
- **E-cigarette Use (`e_cig_ever`)**: Neither predictor was significant.
- **Marijuana Use (`mj_ever`)**: Both predictors were not significant.
- **Alcohol Use (`alc_ever`)**: Only maternal cotinine levels were significant (p = 0.000357).

#### c. Externalizing Behaviors

Examining ETS effects on adolescent externalizing behaviors:

- **Hyperactivity (`swan_hyperactive`)**: Only maternal cotinine levels were significant (p = 0.0489).
- **Externalizing Behaviors (`Bpm_ext`)**: Neither predictor was significant.

## Conclusion

Our analysis provides insight into the potential risks associated with maternal smoking during pregnancy and environmental tobacco exposure postpartum on adolescent behaviors:

- SDP, especially maternal smoking, appears to elevate the risk for adolescent emotional regulation issues.
- SDP and ETS exposure have varied effects on substance use in adolescents. SDP increases the use of cigarette, E-cigarette, and marijuana. ETS increases the use of cigarette, E-cigarette, and alcohol. 
- ETS exposure, particularly maternal cotinine levels postpartum, shows more pronounced effects on certain behaviors like cigarette use and hyperactivity.

Further studies are required to verify these findings and explore potential interventions.
